## Developer's Guidelines

`fqs` started as a project to explore several language features by
building an application (file queries) of personal interest. Although
the set of features that `fqs` implements is tested, there are many
things that could be changed once the focus actually shifts to the
application itself. Some examples include using standard data formats
and types, following existing query engines more closely (especially
to improve aggregate plans), adding a number of scalar functions,
adding various query features, etc. If you have interest to contribute
any, feel free to send us a PR.
